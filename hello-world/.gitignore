# These are files that we want Git to ignore in our folder, usually because
# they are auto-generated and aren't relevant to other developers.

# We always make sure to ignore the `node_modules` folder, because this folder
# should be generated by each developer when running `npm install` or
# `npm update`.
node_modules

# Sometimes, Node will output log files with a `.log` extension that indicate
# what went wrong. These are only relevant to you, so don't include them.
