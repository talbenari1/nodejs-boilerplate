// This is the main (and only) JS file that this package runs. You can run this
// file by calling either `node index.js` or `npm start` - but `npm start` just
// calls `node index.js` anyway. Check out `package.json` to see how this is
// set up.

// `console` is a global variable in Node.js that refers to an instance of the
// Console class. It is set up by default to print to stdout and stderr, and
// there are lots of different things you can do with it. Check out the
// documentation here: https://nodejs.org/api/console.html.
console.log('Hello, world!')

// P.S. - You may have noticed that I'm missing a semicolon. That's because in
// JavaScript, semicolons are optional! Just like tabs vs. spaces, omitting the
// semicolon is a matter of personal preference (I prefer to omit them).
